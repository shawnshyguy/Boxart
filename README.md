# Boxart Database
The Boxart Database is a work-in-progress project of mine to make high-quality scans of game discs, cartridges, and so forth easily and publicly accessible

## About
Each item is scanned in at 300dpi, adjusted in Photoshop if need be and then exported as a PNG. I wanna scan in boxarts (not just the front, but all sides), cartridges, discs, manuals, inserts, and whatever else might come with a game.

## Why?
Preservation is important, for one. Another reason is just the lack of a solid source for these. Sources like [IGDB](https://www.igdb.com/discover), [GameTDB](https://www.gametdb.com/), and plenty more have an incredible amount of boxarts and such, but of varying quality, and of varying media. For instance, IGDB is a great source, until you want the game's disc art. This project is intented to be a ground-up, curated source of high quality scans of game cartridges, boxes, manuals, and everything else.

## Can I help?
Absolutely! Just make a fork and make a pull request with your added scans. I'll check em over and if they'll all good, I'll merge! If you're not sure on how forks and pull requests work, you can also just message me on Discord, @Shawn#3462.

### A few more notes

- The games scanned in right now are just some cartridges I scanned in for a test run one day, so they're kinda messy, blurry, and not all are properly cropped, but they're just in here as a proof-of-concept more than anything at the moment.
- Some of the carts I scanned in are kinda dirty. While this is also mostly due to the proof-of-concept nature of the DB at the moment, if you have any media you want to submit with blemishes, scratches, etc, they can still be accepted as long as they're within reason. Alongside that, if you have any submissions you want to make that are in better quality than anything currently here, that'd be highly appreciated as well! I want to make sure to strike a good balance of quantity and quality.
- For anyone wanting specific art, or wanting to know what specific art to upload, [the issues tab](https://github.com/shawnshyguy/Boxart/issues) will make a great place for that! Simply open an issue with the game(s) and platform you want, or look for any open issues to see if you can scan that in yourself!
