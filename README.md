# Boxart Database
The Boxart Database is a work-in-progress project of mine to make high-quality scans of game discs, cartridges, and so forth easily and publicly accessible

## About
Each item is scanned in at 300dpi, adjusted in Photoshop if need be and then exported as a PNG. I wanna scan in boxarts (not just the front, but all sides), cartridges, discs, manuals, inserts, and whatever else might come with a game.

## Why?
Preservation is important, for one. Another reason is just the lack of a solid (and consistent) source for these. Sources like [IGDB](https://www.igdb.com/discover), [GameTDB](https://www.gametdb.com/), and plenty more have an incredible amount of boxarts and such, but of varying quality, and of varying media. For instance, IGDB is a great source, until you want the game's disc art. This project is intented to be a ground-up, curated source of high quality scans of game cartridges, boxes, manuals, and everything else. **What I want more than anything else is to have a central location focused on collecting box art scans that can be printed for physical use or imported for digital use as easily as possible.**

## Can I help?
Absolutely! Just make a fork and make a pull request with your added scans. I'll check em over and if they'll all good, I'll merge! If you're not sure on how forks and pull requests work, or for any other reason, you can message me on Discord, @Shawn#3462.

### A few more notes

- I'm scanning in games as I get around to them. It takes a while, and the scanner is bloody loud, so what's currently in the DB is only a fraction of what exists. I'll put a spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11Clubm4i6VolBypjKrHVA2fQbX7yjq5KkPyTne61a58/edit?usp=sharing) of what I have vs. What I've scanned.
- Some of the carts I scanned in are kinda dirty. While this is also mostly due to the proof-of-concept nature of the DB at the moment, if you have any media you want to submit with blemishes, scratches, etc, they can still be accepted as long as they're within reason. Alongside that, if you have any submissions you want to make that are in better quality than anything currently here, that'd be highly appreciated as well! I want to make sure to strike a good balance of quantity and quality.
- For anyone wanting specific art, or wanting to know what specific art to upload, [the issues tab](https://github.com/shawnshyguy/Boxart/issues) will make a great place for that! Simply open an issue with the game(s) and platform you want, or look for any open issues to see if you can scan that in yourself!
