# Boxart Database
The Boxart Database is a work-in-progress project of mine to make high-quality scans of game discs, cartridges, and so forth easily and publicly accessible

## About
Each item is scanned in at 300dpi, adjusted in Photoshop if need be and then exported as a PNG. I wanna scan in boxarts (not just the front, but all sides), cartridges, discs, manuals, inserts, and whatever else might come with a game.

## Why?
Preservation is important, for one. Another reason is just the lack of a solid source for these. Sources like [IGDB](https://www.igdb.com/discover), [GameTDB](https://www.gametdb.com/), and plenty more have an incredible amount of boxarts and such, but of varying quality, and of varying media. For instance, IGDB is a great source, until you want the game's disc art. This project is intented to be a ground-up, curated source of high quality scans of game cartridges, boxes, manuals, and everything else.

## Can I help?
Absolutely! Just message me on Discord, @Shawn#3462, and mention this repo.
