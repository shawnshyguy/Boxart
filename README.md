# Boxart Database
The Boxart Database is a work-in-progress project of mine to make high-quality scans of game discs, cartridges, and so forth easily and publicly accessible

## About
Each item is scanned in at 300dpi, adjusted in Photoshop if need be and then exported as a PNG. I wanna scan in boxarts (not just the front, but all sides), cartridges, discs, manuals, inserts, and whatever else might come with a game.

## Why?
Preservation is important, for one. Another reason is just the lack of a solid source for these. Sources like [IGDB](https://www.igdb.com/discover), [GameTDB](https://www.gametdb.com/), and plenty more have an incredible amount of boxarts and such, but of varying quality, and of varying media. For instance, IGDB is a great source, until you want the game's disc art. This project is intented to be a ground-up, curated source of high quality scans of game cartridges, boxes, manuals, and everything else.

## Can I help?
Absolutely! Just message me on Discord, @Shawn#3462, and mention this repo.

### A few more notes

- The games scanned in right now are just some cartridges I scanned in for a test run one day, so it's kinda all over the place lol
- Some of the carts I scanned in are kinda dirty. If you want to contribute, you don't need your media in pristine quality! Cartridges and discs get worn from use, and as long as it's not distractingly mauled, I'll more than likely be happy to add it. That being said, for any of the discs/carts/etc uploaded here that are kind of beat up, if a better quality copy gets scanned and uploaded later on, it'll probably replace the original scuffed one.
