# Boxart
A personal repository of boxarts, cart art, etc
## Intro
This repo is meant to be a personal repository of boxart for retroarch. With retroarch, the way it scans for games is Game name (region).extension. However, for cleanliness, I prefer titling my games without the region. A side effect of this, however, is retroarch not recognizing any of my games and consiquently not grabbing any thumbnails for them. This repository is meant to help with that, but also to store thumbnails for anything else I may need them for. Eventually, I would like to have a comprehensive repository for boxarts, discarts, manuals, etc across a variety of games. But for now, this is my personal source for thumbnails, that I offer for anyone else whom may need them.
