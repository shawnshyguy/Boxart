## Folder layout
Each console has it's own folder, and in each console's folder are the games. In these game folders are the boxarts, discarts, and whatever else is applicable. So for instance, if you wanted the disc for Super Mario Galaxy, you would look for this:
```
Nintendo - Wii
└ Super Mario Galaxy
  └ Disc (USA).png
```

## Categories
Each game has one or more of the following
- **Boxart.png** - The full boxart for the game, front, back, and spine (plus more when applicable)
- **Cart.png** - The game's cartridge
- **Cover.png** - Only the front of the game's box
- **Disc.png** - The game's disc. in the case that a game comes on multiple discs (Like *Metal Gear Solid*), subsiquent discs would be numbered (*Disc2.png, Disc3.png,* so on)
- **Extra.png** - Any extras that came with a game (like the *Animal Crossing Memory Card 59*). In the case of multiple extras, they would be labeled *Extra1.png*, *Extra2.png*, and so on
- **Reverse.png** - The inner art, if any, that's sometimes printed on the reverse side of the boxart's insert
- **Insert.png** - Any insert that came with the game (think Club Nintendo codes, etc). Multiple inserts would be titled numerically, such as *Insert1.png, Insert2.png,* and so on
- **Manual.pdf** - The game's manual formatted as a pdf for easier viewing

In certain cases, such as where a game got a re-release as a "Greatest Hits", the GH and non-GH versions would both be under the same folder, labeled such as *disc.png* and *disc (Greatest Hits).png*


Additionally, I'd love to add some categories for games consoles' boxarts, memory card scans, and more, but those would have to come later on.
